COMPLETE CODE NOTE:
  Currently, the different login options and the chat functionalities work. However, we are still trying to fix the chat timer and the matching algorithm to properly match users based on a priority queue (Those with the most similar survey results will be paired with one another). We also still need to implement an animation for when a match is still being found, and we have to fix the logic for when the user reveals/rejects, and we have a lot of css to still adjust. We also would like to make the BLINK eye logo actually blink as a gif.
